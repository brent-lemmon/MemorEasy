<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

This project is intended to provide a simplified and better implemented approach for exporting Snapchat memories compared to the system provided by Snapchat and their Javascript implementation.

When using MemorEasy, you can rapidly download your Memories, while also tagging them with their relevant EXIF data, which Snapchat does not provide. Likewise, the script also saves files with relevant date/time file names instead of SID values.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Below are steps needed to retrieve your Memories_history.html file from Snapchat and then how to install and use this file with MemorEasy.

### Prerequisites

<!--This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
-->

1. [Download your Memories data from Snapchat.](https://help.snapchat.com/hc/en-us/articles/7012305371156-How-do-I-download-my-data-from-Snapchat)
    - When asked which data you would like, only selecting Memories is required for this project, but you may select more data if you wish.
    - Ensure that your data range you want selected is correct. We recommend toggle date selection off to query all Memories on your account.
    - **Note**: This will not export your My Eyes Only folder. This must be done manually in the app.
    - Lastly, when delivered the zip file from Snapchat with your data, unzip and find the "memories_history.html" file. We will use this file in the script.
    - TODO Add images or a GIF showing process of selecting data.
2. Confirm that [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone and enter the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/bransoned/MemorEasy.git
   cd MemorEasy
   ```
2. Create and source a virtual environment (skip this step if you already have a virtual environment you would like to use)
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
3. Install the required libraries
    ```sh
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Copy your "memories_history.html" file into the top level of the project directory
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Running the Script
1. Once the required libraries and user-specific memory file are installed and copied into the directory, you can run the script
    ```sh
    python3 script.py
    ```
    - The script will give output tracking the progress of the downloads. If exporting many memories, this may take some time.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

TODO: Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [X] Edit EXIF data for JPGs and MP4 files.
- [ ] Edit EXIF data for JPGs or MP4s that are downloaded in a ZIP file.
- [ ] Remove ZIP files and combine their PNG layers with the parent PNG or MP4. Add relevant EXIF data when needed.
- [ ] Provide a GUI interface for ease of use by non-power users.
- [ ] Develop a package/executable for ease of portability to non-power users.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/bransoned/MemorEasy/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
